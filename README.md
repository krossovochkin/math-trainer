# math-trainer

Trainer to improve thinking by solving simple math problems.  

There are the following modes supported:
- infinite - solve as many problems as you wish
- limited - solve predefined number of problems
- time attack - solve as many problems as possible in a given amount of time

Training can be:
- simple - solve problem with one operation (includes addition, subtraction or multiplication)
- complex - solve problem, with two operations (includes addition and subtraction)

The result of the operation is always non-negative.

Additionally, operators can be chosen to be encoded to increase complexities.
